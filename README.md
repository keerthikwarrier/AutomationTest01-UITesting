# DealsDray-Automation-Tests - UI Testing
The UI Test of the DealsDray Test.

I have written the code using Nunit with Nunit Attributes for multiple browsers and resolutions. I have used Screenshot class and ITakesScreenshot interface to take the Screenshots with foreach loop to iterate the process for the first 5 links in https://www.getcalley.com/page-sitemap.xml
I directly have written the whole code in one UnitTest1.cs file. In the 2nd project i have structured the test scripts by using Page Object Model.

I have written the code for Desktop version of Chrome,Firefox and Safari and for MobileChrome.  Safari and MobileChrome maynot work as its not executing with the Ipad or mobile device.
